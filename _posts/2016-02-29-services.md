Let's be honest I cannot write down all what I have to offer in my business cards becuase the might look like a folded city map.

All these months I have been posting, and I will keep doing so, tones of content. But I did not make explicit what I have to offer YOU.

Every single time I am asked about what I exactly do as my job title can be understood as a "vague" concept. But IT iS NOt.

A creative designer... are we drawers? Painters? Graphic designers? Artists? Well... I will take a tip from an article i love:

> **_Everything is design. And design is more than a beautiful visual thing. Design is a solution for a problem._**

Yes, I do solve problems. I am here to listen to your demands. Try to go deep inside your mind, and try to meet your needs and requirements.

How I do it?

* Product design
* Graphic design ( branding, logos, flyers, posters, etc)
* Interior design advisor
* Marketing strategist
* Photography
* Artwork: painter and drawer

And MUCH MORE, I don't put my limits in front. YOU give a CHAllenGE and TOGETHER we work to make it happen.

You can also BUY almost everything I publish on my website. JUST EMAIL or CONTACT ME for details.

* For Sale: paintings, drawings, jewellery, T-shirts and much more
* Under demand: an specific image you want to convert into a beautiful painting or drawing, a special photo shoot? Just ask me. NO LIMITS.
